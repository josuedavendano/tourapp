MVP for a Tour App which helps connect tourists and guides in New York City. 
Created by Josue Avendano, Kymberly Rangel, Beliza Baez

In this project we have incorporated a non-relational database and Google authentication services through Firebase.
The purpose of this project is to increase autonomy for tour guides and people seeking tours by creating an environment that
promotes ease of communication between both parties. Tour guides are free of agency and can freely be their own manager. 

This is purely a mock business development produced in 3 weeks by a group of web developement students.
