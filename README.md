Created by Josue Avendano, Kymberly Rangel, Beliza Baez

In this project we have incirporated a non-relational databse and Gogle authentication services through Firebase.
The purpose of this project is to increase autonomy to tour guides and people seeking tours by creating an environment that
promtoes ease of communication between both parties. Tour guides are free of agency and can freely be their own manager. 

This is purely a mock business development produced in 3 weeks by a group of three students.
